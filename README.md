## Bixi_demand_project

Bixi (https://bixi.com) is a bike renting company in Montreal, Canada. Bixi is famous for its summer easy of transportation while enjoying the view of the streets of the city.

The data here trying to predict the hourly ride demand for bike rides considering the environmental conditions. 
Questions answered include:
* How warm conditions encourage bike ride?
* What hours of the day, days of the week, do we get increased ride demand?
* Which stations are prone to more rides?
* A whole lot more ...

We develop ML models using Regression algorithms and Neural Networks. These models can be used in planning bike number to station allocations, and seasonality of demands across the year.
